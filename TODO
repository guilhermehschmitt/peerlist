TODO

stuff that's REALLY important:

- documentation
- documentation
- even more documentation
- update module docs (outdated!)

some ideas to add in the near future:

- 'proxy' router type (RPC or XML from/to other peerlist installs)
- sorting - not easy. have to add data types
- mailto: links clickable? (obfuscation)
- options to clear IX/router cache on click (configurable)
- sorting on AS, grouping by AS

ideas to add later:

- clickable router commands (authentication needed, see next point)
- sessions so people can authenticate and be bound to 1 or more AS'es for previous point
